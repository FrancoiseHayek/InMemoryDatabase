## Reccomendations

Using a real database instead of just maps or tables would make the assignment better because it's more practical. This way, students can learn hands-on about setting up and using databases. Also, explaining different scenarios and making students do tests would make the assignment more interesting. It helps them learn about testing and makes sure their database works in different situations. Students can still pick their favorite programming language, and this makes the assignment better without making it harder for graders. The graders just need to check if the tests cover what they're supposed to.
